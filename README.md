## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js
- **Encryption**: RSA (asymmetric), AES (symmetric), Digital Signatures (Node.js `crypto` module)

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encrypted Messaging**  
  Messages are encrypted using a fresh AES key for every send.

- **Per-Recipient AES Key Encryption**  
  Each recipient gets their own encrypted copy of the AES key (via their public RSA key).

- **Digital Signature Verification**  
  Only messages verified by the sender‚Äôs signature are displayed.

- **Zero Trust Rendering**  
  Unverified messages are hidden until successfully validated.

- **Mnemonic-Based Key Recovery**  
  Each user gets a 12-word recovery phrase to regenerate their RSA key pair.
